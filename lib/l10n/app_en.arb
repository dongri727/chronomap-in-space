The \"ChronoMap\" is a database that encompasses all historical events from the origin of the universe to the endless 'now,' without regard to field. It aims to accurately display temporal and spatial distances, with 'when' and 'where' as mandatory items.",

  "addHintA": "In the \"ChronoMap\", a historical event refers to a single occurrence with information on \"when and where.\" For example, \"Saturn Exploration by Cassini\" is not considered a single occurrence. The registration would be \"September 15, 2017: Cassini Probe Enters Saturnâ€™s Atmosphere, Solar System, Saturn.\" If you want to make this searchable as \"Saturn Exploration by Cassini,\" please add the term \"Cassini-Huygens\" in the web version of the \"ChronoMap\".",
  "addHintB": "Due to the confirmation work of location information, three-dimensional displays of space-related data are not updated in real-time. To expedite the work, we would appreciate your cooperation in inputting heliocentric ecliptic coordinates, Julian dates, galactic coordinates, light-year distances, etc., if possible.",
  "addHintC": "For launch information of probes, etc., we would appreciate it if you could specify the launch site in addition to \"Solar System\" and \"Earth.\"",
