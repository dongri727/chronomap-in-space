  "infoA": "This is an application specialized in the input and output of data related to the universe from the \"ChronoMap\". The \"ChronoMap\" is a database that encompasses all historical events from the origin of the universe to the endless 'now,' without regard to field. It aims to accurately display temporal and spatial distances, with 'when' and 'where' as mandatory items.",

  "infoE": "This app does not acquire any of your personal information, nor does it track or use information on your device.",
  "infoF": "The historical information you register is not linked to you. There are no records of what you register or search for.",
  "infoG": "Information contrary to the purpose of the \"ChronoMap\" will be handled by the administrator as follows.\n1. Correction\n2. Viewing stop (may be made public in the future)\n3. Deletion",
  "infoH": "The historical information you register is treated as a public good, and you yourself cannot delete it. Please be careful not to write personal information. If you want to delete information registered by mistake or find information that should be deleted, please contact the following address.",
  "infoI": "We are looking for people to join us in developing the \"ChronoMap.\" If you are an engineer who can handle Flutter, AWS, PostgreSQL, Unity, etc., or can assist with data entry and correction, please contact us below.",

  "addHintA": "In the \"ChronoMap\", a historical event refers to a single occurrence with information on \"when and where.\" For example, \"Saturn Exploration by Cassini\" is not considered a single occurrence. The registration would be \"September 15, 2017: Cassini Probe Enters Saturnâ€™s Atmosphere, Solar System, Saturn.\" If you want to make this searchable as \"Saturn Exploration by Cassini,\" please add the term \"Cassini-Huygens\" in the web version of the \"ChronoMap\".",
  "addHintB": "Due to the confirmation work of location information, three-dimensional displays of space-related data are not updated in real-time. To expedite the work, we would appreciate your cooperation in inputting heliocentric ecliptic coordinates, Julian dates, galactic coordinates, light-year distances, etc., if possible.",
  "addHintC": "For launch information of probes, etc., we would appreciate it if you could specify the launch site in addition to \"Solar System\" and \"Earth.\"",

Currently, the trajectories of Pioneer 10 (until the end of its mission), Voyager 1 (up to 2004), and Voyager 2 (up to 2004) are included. If you can assist with extending the trajectories of the Voyager spacecraft and creating the trajectories for Pioneer 11 and New Horizons, please contact us at the address below.",
  "isMissionB": "We use heliocentric ecliptic coordinates with the Sun at the center. The concentric circles in the center represent the orbits of Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.",
  "isMissionC": "The spherical point cloud indicates the approximate size of the heliosphere.",
  "isMissionD": "The three axes correspond to the Pisces-Virgo line, the Gemini-Sagittarius line, and the direction towards the North Star (Polaris).",

  "planetsA": "This page displays the trajectories of planetary probes using heliocentric ecliptic coordinates. Currently, the trajectory of Cassini-Huygens (up to 2004) is included. If you can assist with extending the trajectory of Cassini-Huygens and creating the trajectories for other probes, please contact us at the address below.",
  "planetsB": "We use heliocentric ecliptic coordinates with the Sun at the center. The concentric circles in the center represent the orbits of Mercury, Venus, Earth (in blue), Mars, and the asteroid belt.",
  "planetsC": "The two axes of the orbital plane correspond to the Pisces-Virgo line and the Gemini-Sagittarius line, while the orthogonal third axis represents the passage of time in Julian days. Therefore, the trajectories are displayed as spirals ascending with time.",
  "dbViewA": "This page displays cosmic events registered in the database using heliocentric ecliptic coordinates. When data is registered, it will be reflected in real-time.",
  "dbViewB": "We use heliocentric ecliptic coordinates with the Sun at the center. The concentric circles in the center represent the orbits of Mercury, Venus, Earth (in blue), Mars, and the asteroid belt. The two axes of the orbital plane correspond to the Pisces-Virgo line and the Gemini-Sagittarius line, while the orthogonal third axis represents the passage of time in Julian days. Therefore, each event is plotted at the intersection of the position of the specified celestial body and the time.",
  "dbViewC": "Please note that some events may be displayed outside the visible area or may have overlapping text that is difficult to read. We are working on improvements.",
  "scalableA": "This page plots and displays cosmic events registered in the database on an adjustable timeline. When you register data, it will be reflected in real-time.",
  "scalableB": "Step 1\nSelect \"All Items\" to display all events in the database. Select \"In Space\" to display only the events tagged as cosmic. Please make sure to select one of these options.",
  "scalableC": "Step 2\nThe five options at the bottom allow you to select the initial display area. You can scroll through the entire timeline after the initial display.",
  "scalableD": "The logarithmic timeline is set with the year 2100 as the base, with time flowing from top to bottom. Events are fixed on the timeline, so events that occurred close in time are displayed near each other, while events that occurred over a longer span of time are displayed further apart. Zooming in will show details of events from the same era, while zooming out provides an overview of longer periods.",
  "scalableE": "If you find any events plotted in the wrong position, please contact us at the following."
